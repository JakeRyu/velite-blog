Documenting an API before you start implementing it may seem counterintuitive, but it's a practice that can save you a lot of time and headaches down the road. In this post, we'll explore why starting with documentation is beneficial and provide a detailed guide on how to do it effectively using tools like OpenAPI.

# Reasons and Justifications

Documenting your API before implementation offers several significant advantages:

## 1. Enables Simultaneous API Client Implementation

When the API documentation is ready before the actual API, client developers can start working on integrating the API into their applications immediately. This allows both the server and client development to proceed in parallel, speeding up the overall project timeline.

## 2. Enhances Team Communication

A well-documented API serves as a single source of truth for all developers. It clearly defines how the API works, what endpoints are available, and what data formats are expected. This clarity improves communication between backend and frontend teams, reducing misunderstandings and potential integration issues.

## 3. Ultimately Saves Time

Although writing documentation upfront may seem like extra work, it pays off in the long run. Good documentation makes maintenance easier and helps onboard new team members more quickly. It also reduces the time spent on back-and-forth clarifications and troubleshooting during development.

# Detailed Guide: Documenting with OpenAPI

Let's dive into the specifics of documenting your API using OpenAPI.

## Using OpenAPI

OpenAPI is a popular specification for API documentation. It allows you to describe your API's endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods in a standardized format. Here’s a basic example of an OpenAPI specification:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Example API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
```

This YAML file describes an API with a single endpoint `/users` that responds with a list of user names.

## Publishing and Operating Your Documentation

Once you've written your OpenAPI specification, you need to publish and manage it so that it’s easily accessible. Here are some steps to do that:

1. **Setting Up Swagger UI**
   - Swagger UI is a tool that generates interactive documentation from OpenAPI specifications. Install Swagger UI and link it to your specification file to create a user-friendly web page for your API documentation.

2. **Hosting on GitHub Pages**
   - You can host your API documentation on GitHub Pages. Push your OpenAPI files to a GitHub repository and configure GitHub Pages to serve these files. This makes your documentation easily accessible to your team and external developers.


# Conclusion

Starting with API documentation might seem like an extra step, but it significantly boosts your team's productivity and reduces future issues. Clear documentation enhances communication, facilitates parallel development, and ultimately saves time by minimizing errors and misunderstandings. So, before you dive into coding your next API, take a moment to document it first. Your future self will thank you.



APIs without a human and machine-readable specification are harder to design, build, test, secure, manage, document and use. API providers use specifications such as OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for REST, GraphQL Schema for GraphQL or Protobuf for gRPC to make it easier to deliver APIs.
