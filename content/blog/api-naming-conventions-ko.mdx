# 잘못된 이름

`/getAllProducts`, `/UsersList`, `/payments/{memberId}` 같은 API 엔드포인트를 만났을 때 어떤 기분이 드는가? 나는 일관적이지 않고 불규칙한 작명을 보면 답답함을 느낀다. 잘못된 네이밍 컨벤션은 가장 단순한 작업조차 잘못된 사례로 전락시킬 수 있다.

## 잘못된 예시와 문제점:

1. `/getAllProducts`
    - **Problem**: 이름에 동사(get)가 포함되어 있는데, 이는 HTTP 메서드(GET)로 표현되어야 한다. 동사를 포함한 이름은 특정 동작을 암시하기 때문에 자원이 아닌 액션을 나타낸다. RESTful API에서 모든 것은 자원(Resource)으로 간주하는데 상폼 정보는 `/products`라는 자원으로 접는하는 것이 좋다.
    - **Confusion**: `GET /getAllProducts`를 뜯어서 보자면 세가지 이유로 좋지 않다. 첫번째로 get이 중복 사용되었다, 두번째로 `getAll`은 `products`와 의미가 중복된다. 세번째로 `/getTopSellingProducts`, `/getMostRecommendedProducts` 등으로 추가가 예상되는 엔드포인트 때문에 목록은 끝없이 늘어날 것이다. 정리하자면 동사는 Http Verb로 대신하여, `GET /products`만으로 충분한 의미를 전달할 수 있다.

2. `/UsersList`

    - **Problem**: Combining a plural noun with another noun (List) is redundant and less clear. The name should represent a resource collection.
    - **Confusion**: If there’s a `/UserDetails`, it’s not immediately clear if it’s for a single user or multiple users. Consistency in naming is key.

3. `/payments/{memberId}`

    - **Problem**: The URI suggests that `memberId` is an identifier for payments, which can be misleading. It might imply that `memberId` is actually a payment ID.
    - **Confusion**: Developers might assume that `/payments/{memberId}` retrieves a specific payment based on `memberId`, rather than understanding it’s related to a member. This can lead to misinterpretation and errors.


# The Importance of Good Naming Conventions
> Consistency, readability, and maintainability - these are the trifecta of good API design. Consistent naming helps developers know what to expect, readable names reduce the cognitive load, and maintainable names make updates a breeze.

# Naming Conventions

## General Guidelines

1. **HTTP Verbs for Operations**: Let HTTP methods do the action-talking. Use `GET /books` instead of `/getBooks`.
1. **Use Nouns for Resources**: Think of your resources as entities. For instance, `/users` and `/orders` are intuitive and clear.
1. **Use Plural Names**: Plural names like `/books` make it clear you're dealing with a collection.
1. **Use URL Parameters for Single Items**: For a single item, use a URL parameter, `{resourceId}`, immediately after the plural resource name. For example, `/users/{userId}` and `/books/{bookId}` clearly indicate that you are referencing a specific item within the collection.
1. **Styles**:
    - Use forward slash to indicate hierarchical relationships.
    - Use hyphens `-` to improve readability  (`/user-orders` vs `/user_orders`).
    - Use lowercase.
    - Don't use trailing forward slashes.
    - Don't use underscores `_` as they can be confused with link formatting.
    - Don't use file extensions like /managed-devices.xml.

## Structuring Resource URIs

1. **Hierarchical Relationships**: Show relationships like `/users/{userId}/orders`.
1. **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: Use query parameters for these operations. For example:
    - Filtering: `/books?author=tolkien`
    - Sorting: `/books?sort=asc`
    - Pagination: `/books?page=2`
1. **Versioning**: Maintain backward compatibility and manage changes with versioned URIs. For example, use `/v1/books` to indicate version 1 of the API.
1. **Use Singular Names to Denote Resource Archetypes**: In cases where you need to denote a specific type or archetype of a resource, use singular names within the plural collection. This helps to specify sub-categories or roles within a broader resource category while maintaining clarity and consistency. For example:
    - `GET /user-management/users/admin`: This URI clearly indicates that you are fetching users who are of the "admin" type within the user-management context. By specifying admin, you denote a specific archetype of user. This approach avoids ambiguity and makes it clear that the request is for a subset of the user resource, specifically those with the admin role.
1. **Use Verbs to Denote Controller Resources**: Treat controller resources like executable functions and use verbs to clearly denote actions. This helps to distinguish between standard resource operations and specific commands or operations. For example:
    - `POST /cart-management/users/{id}/cart/checkout`: This endpoint indicates an action to checkout a user’s cart. The verb checkout makes it clear that this is a command or operation rather than a simple resource manipulation.
    - `POST /song-management/users/{id}/playlist/play`: This URI specifies an action to play a user’s playlist. The verb play clearly indicates that this is an operation being performed on the playlist resource.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can create APIs that are intuitive and easy to work with, reducing confusion and improving the developer experience.


# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
##  Overusing Nested Resources 

Avoid deep nesting like `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}`. Stick to simple, flat structures.

1. **Flat Resource Structures:**<br />
Instead of deeply nested routes, use flat routes with clear identifiers. For example, rather than `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}`, you can use `/items/{itemId}` and include the related resource identifiers in the query parameters or body if necessary.
    ```http
    GET /items/{itemId}?userId={userId}&orderId={orderId}
    ```
    Even if you have the item identifier and can fetch the item directly, passing `userId` and `orderId` can be beneficial. Including these parameters can save additional database calls for handling related information.

2. **Use Query Parameters:**<br />
Use query parameters to filter and relate resources without nesting. This keeps URLs cleaner and more understandable.
    ```http
    GET /items?userId={userId}&orderId={orderId}
    ```

3. **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):**<br />
Implement HATEOAS to provide links to related resources, allowing clients to navigate between them without needing deep nesting in the URL structure.
    ```json
    {
      "item": {
        "id": "itemId",
        "name": "Item Name",
        "_links": {
          "self": { "href": "/items/itemId" },
          "order": { "href": "/orders/orderId" },
          "user": { "href": "/users/userId" }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

4. **Resource Aggregation:**<br />
Aggregate related data into a single resource when possible. For instance, instead of retrieving an order and its items separately, you could design an endpoint that returns an order along with its items.
    ```http
    GET /orders/{orderId}
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "orderId": "orderId",
      "userId": "userId",
      "items": [
        { "itemId": "item1", "name": "Item 1" },
        { "itemId": "item2", "name": "Item 2" }
      ]
    }
    ```

5. **Resource Expansion:**<br />
Allow clients to request related resources to be expanded inline. This can be done through query parameters that specify which related resources to include.
    ```http
    GET /orders/{orderId}?expand=items,user
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "orderId": "orderId",
      "userId": "userId",
      "user": { "userId": "userId", "name": "User Name" },
      "items": [
        { "itemId": "item1", "name": "Item 1" },
        { "itemId": "item2", "name": "Item 2" }
      ]
    }
    ```

By applying these strategies, you can keep your API endpoints more maintainable and user-friendly while avoiding the complexity of deeply nested structures.

## Inconsistent Naming
In a large project, different team members might name resources, endpoints, variables, and functions differently. For instance, some might use camelCase (`getUserData`), while others use snake_case (`get_user_data`), and some might even use different terms for the same concept (e.g., `userId` vs `user_id` vs `UserID`). This inconsistency can lead to confusion, errors, and increased maintenance time.

1. **Establish Naming Conventions:**<br />
    Create a comprehensive naming convention document that all team members follow. This should cover naming for variables, functions, endpoints, database tables, and any other relevant elements.
    > ### Naming Conventions
    > - Variables and functions: camelCase
    > - Database tables: snake_case
    > - API endpoints: kebab-case
    > - Constants: UPPER_CASE

2. **Use Linters and Code Formatters:**<br />
Integrate linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Spectral for OpenAPI) and code formatters (e.g., Prettier) into your development workflow. Configure them to enforce the naming conventions automatically.

3. **Code Reviews:**<br />
Conduct regular code reviews where naming conventions are checked. Ensure that reviewers are strict about following the agreed-upon conventions.
    ```Markdown
    ## Code Review Checklist
    - [ ] Are naming conventions followed consistently?
    - [ ] Are variable and function names meaningful and descriptive?
    ```

4. **Automated CI/CD Checks:**<br />
Implement CI/CD pipelines that include checks for naming conventions. This can prevent non-conforming code from being merged into the main codebase.

5. **Documentation and Training:**<br />
Regularly update the team on the importance of naming conventions and provide training sessions  for new team members. Documentation should be easily accessible and up-to-date.

By implementing these solutions, you can mitigate the common pitfall of inconsistent naming and maintain a clean, understandable, and maintainable codebase.

## Ignoring Standards

Imagine a team developing an API without following RESTful principles or common HTTP status codes. They might use custom status codes, like `299` for a successful creation instead of the standard `201 Created`, or they might not use proper HTTP verbs (e.g., using `GET` for creating a resource). This can lead to confusion, poor interoperability, and difficulties in maintaining and scaling the application.

1. **Adhere to RESTful API Principles:**<br />
Follow REST principles such as using the correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and proper status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
    ```http
    POST /users
    201 Created
    Location: /users/{userId}
    ```

2. **Use Standard HTTP Status Codes:**<br />
Always use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an HTTP request. This ensures that clients can understand and handle responses correctly.
    ```http
    200 OK – Request succeeded
    201 Created – Resource created successfully
    400 Bad Request – Client error in the request
    401 Unauthorized – Authentication required
    404 Not Found – Resource not found
    500 Internal Server Error – Server encountered an error
    ```

3. **Use Standardized Documentation:**<br />
Document your API using standard formats like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger). This ensures that your API is well-documented and can be easily understood by other developers.
    ```yaml
    # openapi.yaml
    openapi: 3.0.0
    info:
      title: Sample API
      version: 1.0.0
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          summary: Retrieve a list of users
          responses:
            '200':
              description: A list of users
              content:
                application/json:
                  schema:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
    ```

    By following these solutions, you can ensure that your projects adhere to industry standards, making them more reliable, maintainable, and easier to integrate with other systems.

# Importance of API Documentation

Having a centralized API documentation can significantly help in maintaining consistent naming conventions and avoiding mistakes. Here's why API documentation is crucial and some additional thoughts on it:

1. **Centralized Reference:**<br />
A well-maintained API documentation serves as a single source of truth for all endpoints, parameters, and data models. This helps all team members adhere to the same naming conventions.
1. **Consistency:**<br />
By documenting your API, you ensure that everyone understands and follows the established conventions. It reduces the risk of inconsistent naming across different parts of the API.
1. **Ease of Onboarding:**<br />
New team members can quickly get up to speed by referring to the documentation. They can see the correct naming conventions and structures in one place.
1. **Improved Collaboration:**<br />
With clear documentation, developers, testers, and stakeholders can easily understand how the API works, facilitating better collaboration and reducing miscommunication.
1. **Automated Documentation Tools:**<br />
Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman, and others can generate documentation automatically from your codebase. This ensures that your documentation is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
