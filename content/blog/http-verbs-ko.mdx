웹 개발에서 HTTP 메서드는 클라이언트와 서버 간의 소통을 가능하게 하는 중요한 요소이다. 이 메서드들은 웹 애플리케이션에서 데이터를 전송하고 조작하는 다양한 방법을 제공하여, 개발자가 명확하고 효율적으로 자원을 관리할 수 있게 해준다. 이번 글에서는 HTTP 메서드의 역할과 가장 일반적으로 사용되는 메서드들에 대해 자세히 알아본다.

# CRUD Operations

| Verb | CRUD | Collection[^1] | Item[^2] | Idempotent | Responses |

## Responses

| 상태 코드 | 설명 |
|-----------|------|
| 200 OK | 요청이 성공적으로 처리됨. |
| 201 Created | 리소스가 성공적으로 생성됨. |
| 202 Accepted | 요청이 처리되었으며, 완료 대기 중. |
| 204 No Content | 요청이 성공적으로 처리되었으나 반환할 콘텐츠 없음. |
| 400 Bad Request | 요청을 이해할 수 없거나 필요한 매개변수가 없음. |
| 401 Unauthorized | 인증 실패 또는 사용자가 요청한 작업에 대한 권한이 없음. |
| 403 Forbidden | 인증 성공했지만 사용자가 리소스에 접근할 수 없음. |
| 404 Not Found | 요청한 리소스를 찾을 수 없음. |
| 409 Conflict | 충돌로 인해 요청을 처리할 수 없음. |
| 500 Internal Server Error | 서버에서 오류가 발생함. |

# POST
POST 메서드는 리소스를 생성하는 데 사용된다. 리소스 생성은 애플리케이션의 상태를 변경하는 행위 중 하나이기 때문에 그 동작을 여러 번 수행하는 것에 주의해야 한다. 동일한 두 개의 POST 요청을 하면 동일한 데이터를 포함하는 두 개의 리소스가 생성될 가능성이 크다. 이를 멱등성[^3]이 없다고 표현한다. 따라서 멱등성이 필요없는 리소스 요청에만 POST 동사를 사용하자. 멱등성이 필요한 경우에는 PUT을 사용하여 생성 또는 업데이트가 자동으로 관리되도록 할 수 있다.

한편으로, POST는 함수처럼 동작하는 엔드포인트를 트리거하는 데 사용된다. 완료하는 데 시간이 오래 걸릴 수 있는 함수는 202(Accepted)를 즉시 반환하고, 과정이 완료되는 동안 상태를 확인할 수 있는 링크를 제공해야 한다. 이것은 엔드포인트 작명에 동사를 사용하는 예외적인 경우이다.

- **POST /members/import-data**

## POST on a Collection or Item Endpoint?

The POST method is used to create a new resource at a collection endpoint. For instance, to create a new user, you can send a POST request to the `/users` endpoint.

```Http
POST /users
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

This request creates a new user, and the server responds with the ID of the newly created user.

**Response:**

```Http
201 Created
Location: /users/123
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```
In this example, the POST method is used to add a new user to the /users **collection**.

## Why POST is Not Used for Item Endpoints

Item endpoints already include an ID that identifies a specific resource. Therefore, a POST request is not appropriate. For example, if the user data already exists at `/users/123`, the following POST request would be incorrect:

```Http
POST /users/123
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```

This request doesn't make sense because POST is used to create new resources, and trying to create a new resource at an existing resource's endpoint is illogical. Instead, you should use the PUT or PATCH methods to update an existing resource.


# GET
The GET method is used to retrieve a representation of a resource. This is idempotent which means
calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times. This should never modify any
resources on the server. GET verbs can retrieve both a collection or a single item. For
the collection of items, use pagination, sorting, and filtering to navigate through big
lists.

## Why GET Can Be Used for Both Collection and Item Endpoints
The GET method can be used for both collection and item endpoints because its primary purpose is to fetch data, whether it's a list of resources or a specific resource.

## GET on a Collection Endpoint
When you use GET on a collection endpoint, it retrieves a list of resources. For example, to get a list of users, you would send a GET request to the `/users` endpoint.

```Http
GET /users
```

This request retrieves all users, and the server responds with a list of user objects.

**Response:**

```Http
200 OK
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "janedoe@example.com"
  }
]
```

In this example, the GET method is used to fetch all users in the /users collection.

## GET on an Item Endpoint
When you use GET on an item endpoint, it retrieves a specific resource identified by its ID. For example, to get a specific user with the ID 123, you would send a GET request to the `/users/123` endpoint.

```Http
GET /users/123
```

This request retrieves the user with the ID 123, and the server responds with the user object.

**Response:**

```Http
200 OK
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```
In this example, the GET method is used to fetch a single user from the `/users` collection. 

<Callout type="warning">
The GET method is versatile and can be used to retrieve both collections and individual items. It is idempotent and does not alter the state of resources on the server, making it suitable for read-only operations.
</Callout>

# PUT 
The PUT method is most often utilized for UPDATE capabilities. This replaces the whole object while
PATCH partially replaces the object. However, PUT can also be used to create a
resource when the resource id is chosen by the client instead of by the server. As the
client send an id, the server can create or update a resource depending on its
existence, a.k.a. UPSERT.

On a successful update, return a 200 (or a 204 if returning no content in the body) from a PUT. If you are using PUT to create, return HTTP status of 201 on its successful creation. A body in the response
is optional; remember that providing one consumes more bandwidth. Returning a link via a Location header during its creation is not necessary since the client already sets the resource ID. It is recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent, and use POST for non-idempotent requests.

## Why PUT Can Be Used for Both Creating and Updating Resources
The PUT sends a complete representation of a resource to the server. If the resource exists, it is updated; if it does not exist, it can be created.

## PUT on an Item Endpoint
When you use PUT on an item endpoint, it updates the resource identified by its ID. For example, to update the user with ID 123, you would send a PUT request to the `/users/123` endpoint.

```http
PUT /users/123
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```
This request updates the user with ID 123, and the server responds with a status indicating the outcome.

**Response:**

```http
200 OK
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```

## PUT for Creating a Resource
If the resource does not exist and the client provides the resource ID, the PUT method can be used to create the resource. For example, if there is no user with ID 123, the same PUT request would create a new user with that ID.

```http
PUT /users/123
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**

```http
201 Created
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
PUT is idempotent and requires a complete representation of the resource. When used on an item endpoint, it can either update the existing resource or create a new one if it does not exist. PUT __should not be used on collection endpoints__ as it operates on individual resources identified by their IDs.
</Callout>

# PATCH
The PATCH method is used for modify capabilities. The request only contains the changes to the resource, and not the complete resource. It is neither safe nor idempotent according to the HTTP specifications. If the outcome should be idempotent, use PUT with a whole object. 

PUT / PATCH are the action to an item. If a request is made to a collection URI (without an id), return
405 (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to update every resource in the entire collection.

## Why PATCH is Used for Partial Updates
The PATCH method is designed for situations where you need to update only certain fields of a resource without modifying the entire resource. This makes PATCH more efficient than PUT when only partial updates are needed.

## PATCH on an Item Endpoint
When you use PATCH on an item endpoint, it applies partial modifications to the resource identified by its ID. For example, to update only the email of the user with ID 123, you would send a PATCH request to the `/users/123` endpoint.

```http
PATCH /users/123
{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```
This request updates the email field of the user with ID 123, and the server responds with a status indicating the outcome.

**Response:**

```http
200 OK
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

## When to Use PATCH
Use the PATCH method when you need to make partial updates to a resource. PATCH is particularly useful when:

- You need to update a few fields of a resource.
- The resource is large, and sending the entire resource representation would be inefficient.
- You want to avoid accidentally overwriting other fields of the resource.

## Idempotency of PUT and PATCH
While PATCH is not idempotent by default, you can design your PATCH operations to be idempotent by ensuring that applying the same PATCH request multiple times yields the same result. However, this requires careful consideration and implementation.

### Idempotency in PUT:

- The PUT method is designed to replace the entire resource at the given URL with the provided data. If you send the same PUT request multiple times, the state of the resource remains the same after each request, making it idempotent.

### Idempotency in PATCH:

The PATCH method is intended for partial updates, meaning it only changes specified fields of a resource. Whether PATCH is idempotent can depend on how the server handles the PATCH requests. If the server can guarantee that applying the same PATCH request multiple times will yield the same result, then PATCH can be considered idempotent.
However, in practice, PATCH requests may not be idempotent because the partial update might rely on the current state of the resource. For example, if a PATCH request increments a counter, applying the same request multiple times would result in different states (e.g., incrementing the counter multiple times).

- **Idempotent PATCH Request**

    If the PATCH request is designed to set a specific field to a particular value, it can be idempotent.

    ```http
    PATCH /users/123
    {
      "email": "newemail@example.com"
    }
    ```

    This request sets the email field to "newemail@example.com". If you send this request multiple times, the email remains "newemail@example.com", making it idempotent.

- **Non-idempotent PATCH Request**

    If the PATCH request is designed to increment a field's value, it is not idempotent.

    ```http
    PATCH /users/123
    {
      "incrementLoginCount": true
    }
    ```
    This request increments the login count. Sending this request multiple times will increment the login count each time, resulting in different states.

<Callout type="warning">
The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource. It is efficient for updating specific fields without modifying the entire resource. Unlike PUT, PATCH does not require a complete resource representation and is designed for partial modifications. Use PATCH when you need to update only certain aspects of a resource, but be mindful of its non-idempotent nature by default.
</Callout>

 
# DELETE
The DELETE method is used to delete a resource that's been identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return a HTTP status of 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps containing the representation of the deleted item. Otherwise, return a HTTP status of 204 (NO CONTENT) without a response body. 

The DELETE method is idempotent because, regardless of how many times you call it, the outcome remains the same. If the resource is deleted successfully the first time, subsequent DELETE requests for the same resource will return a 404 (Not Found) status since the resource no longer exists. This is a caveat of the DELETE idempotent.

## DELETE on an Item Endpoint
When you use DELETE on an item endpoint, it removes the specific resource identified by its ID. For example, to delete the user with ID 123, you would send a DELETE request to the `/users/123` endpoint.

```http
DELETE /users/123
```
If the deletion is successful, the server responds with a status indicating the outcome.

**Response:**

```http
200 OK
{
  "message": "User deleted successfully"
}
```
Alternatively, the server might respond with:

```http
204 No Content
```

## DELETE on a Collection Endpoint
Using DELETE on a collection endpoint typically is not recommended because it implies deleting all resources in the collection, which is usually not the intended action. Always specify the resource ID to avoid unintended mass deletions.

## Handling Non-Existent Resources
If you attempt to delete a resource that does not exist, the server should return a 404 (Not Found) status.

**Response:**

```http
404 Not Found
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
The DELETE method is used to remove resources identified by a URI. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical DELETE requests have the same effect as a single request. DELETE should be used on item endpoints to remove specific resources, and attempting to delete a non-existent resource should return a 404 status.
</Callout>

# Non-CRUD Operations

| Verb | Collection | Item | Idempotent | Responses |
|------|------------|------|------------|-----------|
| HEAD    | ✔       | ✔    | ✔          | **200** (OK), returns only headers.<br />**404** (Not Found), if id is invalid or not found.<br />**400** (Bad Request), if a query parameter is invalid. |
| OPTIONS | ✔       | ✔    | ✔          | **200** (OK), returns allowed HTTP methods.<br />**404** (Not Found) if the resource does not exist. |

# HEAD
The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it does not return a response body. It is used to retrieve the headers of a resource, which can be useful for checking if a resource exists or for retrieving metadata such as the Content-Type or Content-Length.

## Why Use HEAD

The HEAD method is useful for:
- **Checking Resource Existence**: Before making a GET request, you can use HEAD to check if a resource exists.
- **Retrieving Metadata**: Get information about a resource without downloading the entire content.

## HEAD on a Collection or Item Endpoint?
The HEAD method can be used on both item and collection endpoints. It retrieves the headers without a response body, making it useful for checking the existence of resources and retrieving metadata without the overhead of fetching the entire resource or collection.

```http
HEAD /users/123
HEAD /users
```

If the resource exists, the server responds with headers but no body.

**Response:**
```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 123
```

If the resource does not exist, the server responds with a 404 status.

**Response:**
```http
404 Not Found
```

# OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource. It returns the allowed HTTP methods and other options.

## Why Use OPTIONS

The OPTIONS method is useful for:
- **Discovering Supported Methods**: Determine which HTTP methods are supported by a resource.
- **CORS Preflight Requests**: Commonly used in Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to check which HTTP methods and headers are allowed.

## OPTIONS on an Item Endpoint
When you use OPTIONS on an item endpoint, it retrieves the HTTP methods supported by the resource identified by its ID. For example, to find out what operations can be performed on the user with ID 123, you would send an OPTIONS request to the `/users/123` endpoint.

```http
OPTIONS /users/123
```

The server responds with the allowed methods.

**Response:**
```http
200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
```

## OPTIONS on a Collection Endpoint
Similarly, OPTIONS can be used on a collection endpoint to retrieve the allowed methods for the collection.

```http
OPTIONS /users
```

**Response:**
```http
200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, OPTIONS
```

<Callout type="warning">
The HEAD method is used to retrieve headers without a response body, useful for checking resource existence and metadata. The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for a resource, useful for discovering supported HTTP methods and CORS preflight requests.
